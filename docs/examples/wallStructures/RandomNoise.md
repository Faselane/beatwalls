# RandomNoise

[video](https://youtu.be/pwFA2ul9RBk) of all Wallstructures in this file

creates small random points in a given area.


## Example 1

![I should be a picture](../pictures/RandomNoise/10.png)

```yaml
# Random Noise over 4 beats
10 RandomNoise
    p1 = -4,0,0
    p2 = 4,4,4
```

--- 

## Example 2

![I should be a picture](../pictures/RandomNoise/20.png)

note: pictures use less walls to make understanding them easier

```yaml
# create laser-like effects on the sides.
# This uses negative duration for hyper walls.
20  RandomNoise
    p1 = 3,0,0
    p2 = 4,4,4
    amount = 32          # create 32 walls
    duration = -3  # negative duration
    mirror = 6           # mirror on 0/2, this leads to more random looking walls.
```

--- 

## Example 3

![I should be a picture](../pictures/RandomNoise/30.png)

note: pictures use less walls to make understanding them easier

```yaml
# creates some weird floor and ceiling effects
# this structures makes heavy use of the random feature. 
# Not all parametes support this tho. check the documentation
30 RandomNoise
    p1 = -8,0,0
    p2 = 8,0,4
    amount = 16   # create 16 walls
    repeat = 2   # but create the structure 2 times
    mirror = 4
    changeDuration = random(-2,-3)
    changeWidth = random(0,0.5)
```
