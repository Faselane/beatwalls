# History

This document tries to save the history of wall mapping and its important pieces of history.
There is a bunch of stuff that I either do not know about or simply forgot.

If you have anything to add hit me up on my discord or

## Back in the days

In the early days of beatsaber everyone was bound to the same 3 wall types.
But that did not stop mappers, since because of ~~bugs~~ features there were some Fancy stuff you could do with them.

__hyper walls__ (walls that have a negative duration) existed for as long as I can remember and were used commonly.

__fake walls__ (walls, that don't hurt you) were also known about and used in maps like [under the sea](https://beatsaver.com/beatmap/195f)

Those were eventually with editors like mediocre mapper but seen rarely.
To be honest, it was a bit boring.

## Mapping Extension

__BOOM__ [Mapping Extension](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/MappingExtensions) arrived January 2019. 
Suddenly you could place walls __anywhere__ you want.

No mapping programs supoorted it, but nobody cared. 
Mappers like 
[Rustic](https://beatsaver.com/uploader/5cff0b7298cc5a672c84e8c4),
[Exce]()
or [Ruckus](https://beatsaver.com/uploader/5cff0b7398cc5a672c84f1d8)
created awesome wallmaps only with the json and their Text editor.
[The Math](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/MappingExtensions#more-precise-wall-adjustments)
was hard but they were harder and showed everyone what was possible

## Early days of scripting

This was when people started to develop scripts. 

There were converter, that made the math easier or tools to copy paste with extra stuff.
And tech-savy mappers wrote their own scripts for specific maps.

I also started working on Beatwalls at the same time.
On Thu Jul 18 11:40:58 2019 the first Commit to Beatwalls occured and a week later got its first Version.
Back there it was a completly different Program, where you had a bunch of walls in json format laying around somewhere and used bookmarks to place them on the map.
It was horrible.

### The Results

But it was worth it! 

BANG-BANG-BANG - three maps showed up and stole the show.
[Sky Fracture VIP](https://beatsaver.com/beatmap/6b55), 
[Air](https://beatsaver.com/beatmap/67ba)
and [The Wall](https://beatsaver.com/beatmap/6b55)
all got released in October 2019 and got thousands of up votes and millions of clicks.

Suddenly there was a demand for more. 

## MK5

Luckily, a month before an [update](https://github.com/squeaksies/MediocreMapper/releases/tag/Mk5) for Mediocre Mapper arrived, and it supported mapping extension. 
With that you could create a Wall with 2 clicks.

A bunch of beautiful art-maps like [palm Trees](https://beatsaver.com/beatmap/68f4)

Beatwalls also got updated and slowly reached the level where it is today.

## Noodle Extension

Suddenly [Noodle Extension](https://github.com/aeroluna/NoodleExtensions)
came around and raised everyone's interest and their noodles.

It lifted the previous requirements of ME (no walls starting in the ground or higher than 5 blocks) 
and brought in some new features.

Suddenly you could rotate walls around the player and around themself.
This lead to awesome maps like [Unholy Crusade](https://beatsaver.com/beatmap/97ac)

## The modern area

And thats where we are today.
