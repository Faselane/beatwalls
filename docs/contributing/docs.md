# Docs

## Improving

I'm not good at writing docs, so this would help a ton.

For contributing you need
 - a github account
 - any text editor
 
The progress for contributing is as follows:
- select the page in the wiki
- scroll to the bottom and click `help improve this page`.
- fork the repository
- change the file and commit the changes
- create a pull request with the commits

## Translation

This would help a ton to make beatwalls accessible in other languages.
The most sense would make japanese and france.

The steps above still work, but setting it up might be a bit more tricky.
Please get in touch with me through github or discord.
