A tool to create [wallmaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4bk8ym3fIQ) for Beat Saber.
Check out the docs under https://spooky.moe/beatwalls.

Created with <3 by your friendly ghost.

Change Log:
- Added Beziercurve and ExpCurve, which is basically a Beziercurve with one instead of 2 Control Points.
- Sort Walls in the helix by z, so the colors don't get mixed up now.
